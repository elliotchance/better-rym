## Contributing

I take any and all PRs. So far I've worked with a few talented developers and would love to work with more:

- ~lempamo: additional collection filters, label autofill, inline profile editing/markup preview, advanced autofill options, and speed/size optimizations
- ~code_gs: collection filters feature
- ~flushed_emoji: Melon import support

Issues are also always welcome. This is the best way to get my attention on a bug or feature request.

### Dev Environment

### Setup

1. Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com)
2. Create a `.env` file at the project root with the following format:

```
SPOTIFY_ID=<client id>
SPOTIFY_SECRET=<client secret>
YOUTUBE_KEY=<api key>
```

3. Create a [Spotify client ID/secret](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/) and a [YouTube API key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started#before-you-start) and place them in the `.env` file.

### Dev Server

BetterRYM includes a dev server which will hot-reload your browser automatically as you work. It passes source maps and unminified code to the browser for easier debugging.

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start dev server
yarn dev
```

Load the unpacked extension from `./output` into your browser ([Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest), [Firefox](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/))

### Production

Use this to generate a production build with minified code.

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Build for all browsers (Chrome and Firefox)
yarn prod
```
